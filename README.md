•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To properly interpret a user’s needs, you first need to research and analyze the functionality of the program you wish to build. Gathering feedback from users to find what their opinions are, finding out what they like and dislike about programs like the one you are building. Then analyze and break down these opinions, prioritizing what would make the program work better than other programs, promoting user satisfaction. 

Creating user stories helps with this, because they outline what the user wants, what that function would allow the user to do, and why it is important. User stories provide small tasks that the development team can implement to satisfy the most prioritized needs and/or wants from the user.


•	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by breaking it down into small tasks as to not overwhelm myself. Agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work is working incrementally and iteratively, continuously testing the program to make it functions properly, fixing bugs or mistakes along the way, and allowing for changes to be made at any time during the process. 


•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development, I need to communicate effectively with my team. If I do not communicate clearly, I run the risk of misunderstandings which could lead to projects not being completed properly. I should take responsibility for the work that I do and ask for or provide assistance when necessary. Team members need to be able to trust each other, proper collaboration can lead to higher quality products to be developed.
